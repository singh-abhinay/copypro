Batch/Queue processing is expected when catalog is big in size
Exception handling is must
Logging feature is good to have -- Add logs of all the activities happening while code execution
PSR/Magento 2 Coding Guidelines should be followed
Make use of Inheritance, dependency injection, interface, abstract class and static methods
Organized code base using helper/libraries will be a plus point
